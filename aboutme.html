          <li>I am twenty years young, and I am living my best life. I CAN'T LIE.</li>
          <li>I am blessed, I get to do what I love everyday, I am healthy, I am access to food, and I got a roof over my head. I cannot complain at all. I got family right now, who would literally die to be in my position so I am extremely grateful.  </li>
          <li>I attend UMO and study finance.</li>
          <li>I also play football. I am a cornerback and been doing that now for half life. I LOVE IT! </li>
          <li>I am almost done with school and seeing what life brings me. I know I will be successful because of the hard-work that I put in everyday.  God put me on this Earth, for a reason, and I will fulfill his mission. I hope one day I can save the lives of millions of people from both my parents birthplaces. I’ve had dreams of me making a difference in peoples since I was young, so I deel like it's my destiny.   </li>

<li> I still remember the day when my girlfriend bought me a puppy  for my birthday. It was instant love the very moment I looked into her hazel eyes.I knew she was a big responsibility and that I should be very careful . I focused all my energies on my little dog that I named Ellie. She became my best friend and I grew extremely attached to her. We do almost everything together, especially cuddle.

Being with Ellie taught me many things about life and emotions. Before having her, I never had any feelings of responsibility. I always thought that my actions would never be able to affect anyone on such a large magnitude. As I got more attached to her, I started realizing many things about myself and my feelings that I had never experienced before. She definitly has covered the missing piece , of my the puzzle I call life.</li>
