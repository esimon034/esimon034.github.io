<h1>The Life of Turbo</h1>

<br><i>Teenage Years</i>

<ul>
      <li>At the age of 13, I moved away from my mother to attend a private school.</li>
       <li>I attended Xaverian Brothers High School in Westwood Massachusetts. </li>
       <li>I fell in love with the sport of football and pursued it as a career.</li>
         <li>XB was one of the best HS football teams around my area, so we played the best competition, which gave me the opportunity to make it where I am today. The University Of Maine.</li>
        <li>At XB, I meet my two best pals, De’Andre and Tipt. We become brothers quickly and did almost everything together. We brought the best out of each other, and expected nothing but the best from each other. These are my brothers as well as my business partners. We plan to open the some business in the near future. These are both sons of NFL hall of famers, so I believe that we can make some really big powerful moves together. </li>

     <p> “During college, I met the love of my life. She's an angle from above. The first time I saw her, I knew she was going to be mine. She's such a bright young lady and her future is brighter than a sun. ” To be honest the first couple months of our relationship, I strongly believed that we probably wasn’t going to work out. I used to tell myself that she had too many flaws, and we probably would argue everyday. This was all bullspit, and I think the true reason was that I was afraid of commitment and opening up to her. Throughout my 20 years of life, I’ve experience a lot of things which has made me who I am today. In the early stages of our relationship I failed to realize communication is very important and is the key to a successful relationship. I strongly believe that everything in life comes down to relationships. Relationships are very important to who you are as an individual, and improving my relationships will help me grow as a person. To be successful in any road you travel in life, from football to business, one has to know how to create and maintain strong relationships. </p>

<li> I still remember the day when my girlfriend bought me a puppy  for my birthday. It was instant love the very moment I looked into her hazel eyes.I knew she was a big responsibility and that I should be very careful . I focused all my energies on my little dog that I named Ellie. She became my best friend and I grew extremely attached to her. We do almost everything together, especially cuddle.

Being with Ellie taught me many things about life and emotions. Before having her, I never had any feelings of responsibility. I always thought that my actions would never be able to affect anyone on such a large magnitude. As I got more attached to her, I started realizing many things about myself and my feelings that I had never experienced before. She definitly has covered the missing piece , of my the puzzle I call life.</li>

She became my best friend and I grew extremely attached to her. We do almost everything together, especially cuddle. Being with Ellie taught me many things about life and emotions. Before having her, I never had any feelings of responsibility really. I always thought that my actions would never be able to affect anyone on such a large magnitude. As I got more attached to her, I started realizing many things about myself and my feelings that I had never experienced before. She definitely has covered the missing piece, of my the puzzle I call life.</p>
