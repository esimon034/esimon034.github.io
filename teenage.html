<br><i>All About Me</i>
     <ul>
          <li>I was born in Boston, Massachussetts.</li>
          <li>I grew up living with my mother and five brothers.</li>
          <li>I am of Haitian and Jamaican descent.</li>
          <li>I'm outgoing and always look forward to meeting new people.</li>
          <li>I love to do physical and adventurous activities. </li>
          <li>I think positively and can execute on almost any difficult tasks.</li>
         <li> I am determined to do well in anything I do and also determined to have a successful career.</li>
         <li>I like learning things about other cultures and religions.</li>
         <li>I really enjoy talking to foreigners.</li>
         <li>I love to travel. Doesn't have to be fancy at all, because I just enjoy being around other people's culture. </li>
          <li>My name is Ernest Curtis Simon.</li>
          <li>The most important person in my life is my mother, Magalie Simon. There's no other woman like her. There are so many great traits I love and admire about my mom. She is the most hardest-working, strong, optimistic, and beautifulest lady I know. She raised five amazing boys by herself, and did a hell of a job at it. I love this woman so much. The courage to go through what immmigrants go through, and working three jobs is what motivates me everyday. My mother always puts her sons first, and I am grateful for that. Without her I would have never gotten a scholarship to play the sport that has bless me in so many ways. She pushed me so hard and kept me out of trouble. As a child, I never liked going to school but my mother refused to give up on me. I probably would have been suffocated by the nonsense that happens in my neighborhood, if it wasnt for my mother. She is my hero. My mother is my greatest influence. She supports me, and the decisions I make, showed me that success comes from hard work, she inspires me and taught me to always believe in myself.</li>

          <li>I love to spend time with my family. My uncle used to always scold that "Family bonding" is very important. Its importhat that we develop ties and bonds that cannot be breakable. Often kids decide to join gangs becuase they welcome them in, to be a part of their family. so I make sure my cousins know that they have me here. The sacrifices that my family has done for me, is why I am in the position I am today.</li>
          <li>My little cousins, Peter-Scott and Eathon are my world. I am a father figure to them, so I love them like my own. There father past so I am glad God uses me as a role model/father figure for these two wonderful boys. They are so smart and full of joy. They put a smile to my face everytime I see them.</li>

<br><i>Teenage Years</i>

<ul>
      <li>At the age of 13, I moved away from my mother to attend a private school.</li>
       <li>I attended Xaverian Brothers High School in Westwood Massachusetts. </li>
       <li>I fell in love with the sport of football and pursued it as a career.</li>
         <li>XB was one of the best HS football teams around my area, so we played the best competition, which gave me the opportunity to make it where I am today. The University Of Maine.</li>
        <li>At XB, I meet my two best pals, De’Andre and Tipt. We become brothers quickly and did almost everything together. We brought the best out of each other, and expected nothing but the best from each other. These are my brothers as well as my business partners. We plan to open the some business in the near future. These are both sons of NFL hall of famers, so I believe that we can make some really big powerful moves together. </li>

          <li>I am blessed, I get to do what I love everyday, I am healthy, I am access to food, and I got a roof over my head. I cannot complain at all. I got family right now, who would literally die to be in my position so I am extremely grateful.  </li>
          <li>I attend UMO and study finance.</li>
          <li>I also play football. I am a cornerback and been doing that now for half life. I LOVE IT! </li>
          <li>I am almost done with school and seeing what life brings me. I know I will be successful because of the hard-work that I put in everyday.  God put me on this Earth, for a reason, and I will fulfill his mission. I hope one day I can save the lives of millions of people from both my parents birthplaces. I’ve had dreams of me making a difference in peoples since I was young, so I deel like it's my destiny.   </li>
          <li>During college, I met the love of my life. She's an angle from above. The first time I saw her, I knew she was going to be mine. She's such a bright young lady and her future is anything she wants it be. </li>

<li> I still remember the day when my girlfriend bought me a puppy  for my birthday. It was instant love the very moment I looked into her hazel eyes.I knew she was a big responsibility and that I should be very careful . I focused all my energies on my little dog that I named Ellie. She became my best friend and I grew extremely attached to her. We do almost everything together, especially cuddle.

Being with Ellie taught me many things about life and emotions. Before having her, I never had any feelings of responsibility. I always thought that my actions would never be able to affect anyone on such a large magnitude. As I got more attached to her, I started realizing many things about myself and my feelings that I had never experienced before. She definitly has covered the missing piece , of my the puzzle I call life.</li>
