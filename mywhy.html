    <h1> My why </h1>
    <img src=" ">
    <p> In middle school, I witness a tragic event that destroyed the lives of many haitians. Because of their economic challenges, Haiti was very unprepared for the natural disaster that occured on January 12, 2010. They were hit by a magnitude 7 earthquake that struck just outside of Port au Prince. There were over 300,000 deaths and 3 million and 500,000 people were affected. </p>
    <p> Haiti has had several tropical storms and natural disasters that has ruined the economy but the earthquake that recently occurred had destroyed it. Total damages of this tragedy have reached an estimated total of $7.8 billion. There were so many people affected that even my family didnâ€™t escape the fallout.</p>
    <p> The earthquake was very devastating for a lot of families including mine. I lived in Haiti for part of my youth and when my immediate family and I moved away, many of my aunts and uncles remained there. Therefore they were directly impacted by the earthquake. 6 of my 10 aunts and uncles were killed. They were killed by the collapsing of their home. The weight of the stone and concrete that made their home crushed and suffocated them. My family and I were very devastated by this loss, but my grandmother was mostly affected because that day she lost most of her children. Coping with this loss was not easy and the only thing that helped us heal was time. </p>
    <p> Never did I expect my life to be impacted by a natural disaster. January, 12, 2010 is a day I will forever remember, it is a day that my family was suddenly smaller by 6. This natural disaster is just a reminder of what makes me keep striving everyday. This world that we live in is not guaranteed!</p>
