    <h1> My why </h1>
    <img src=" ">
    <p> In middle school, I witness a tragic event that destroyed the lives of many haitians. Because of their economic challenges, Haiti was very unprepared for the natural disaster that occured on January 12, 2010. They were hit by a magnitude 7 earthquake that struck just outside of Port au Prince. There were over 300,000 deaths and 3 million and 500,000 people were affected. </p>
    <p> Haiti has had several tropical storms and natural disasters that has ruined the economy but the earthquake that recently occurred had destroyed it. Total damages of this tragedy have reached an estimated total of $7.8 billion. There were so many people affected that even my family didnâ€™t escape the fallout.</p>
    <p> The earthquake was very devastating for a lot of families including mine. I lived in Haiti for part of my youth and when my immediate family and I moved away, many of my aunts and uncles remained there. Therefore they were directly impacted by the earthquake. 6 of my 10 aunts and uncles were killed. They were killed by the collapsing </p>
