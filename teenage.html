<h1>The Life of Turbo</h1>

     <br><i>Teenage Years</i>

<ul>
      <li>At the age of 13, I moved away from my mother to attend a private school.</li>
       <li>I attended Xaverian Brothers High School in Westwood Massachusetts. </li>
       <li>I fell in love with the sport of football and pursued it as a career.</li>
         <li>XB was one of the best HS football teams around my area, so we played the best competition, which gave me the opportunity to make it where I am today. The University Of Maine.</li>
        <li>At XB, I meet my two best pals, De’Andre and Tipt. We become brothers quickly and did almost everything together. We brought the best out of each other, and expected nothing but the best from each other. These are my brothers as well as my business partners. We plan to open the some business in the near future. These are both sons of NFL hall of famers, so I believe that we can make some really big powerful moves together. </li>
